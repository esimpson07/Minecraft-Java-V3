# Minecraft-Java-V3

To run this game, you need to download the soundtrack, font and images found at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ENyDl2osUs1Pdm2X-VUZmaian9jcO-Ar/view?usp=sharing
The full game is downloadable at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1weGvIczAAYpAlloM9r3S-4eJNf9MQJKH/view?usp=sharing, and you can unzip it and run it as a BlueJ project.

GameController and DPolygon and Cube have been changed minorly since the full release, so it may be a good idea to edit those.
